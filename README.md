## Overview

AuthiFy is a secure authentication system built using the MERN stack and styled with Tailwind CSS. The project provides features like email verification, password reset functionality, and overall user authentication.
This app uses OTP (One-Time Password) functionality for both **email verification** and **password reset**. Users can easily reset their passwords by receiving an OTP to their registered email, ensuring a secure and smooth user experience.

## Functionality

### 1. **User Registration**
- The user can register with an email and password.
- After registration, an OTP will be sent to the user's email to verify their account.

### 2. **Email Verification**
- The user will receive an OTP in their email to verify their email address.
- The user can submit the OTP on the verification page to complete the process.

### 3. **Password Reset**
- If the user forgets their password, they can request a password reset.
- The system sends an OTP to the userâ€™s registered email to verify the reset request.
- Once the OTP is verified, the user can set a new password.

### 4. **JWT Authentication**
- Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated for the user.
- The token is used to authenticate further requests, ensuring secure access to protected routes.
